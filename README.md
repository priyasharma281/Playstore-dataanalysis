Google Play Store team is about to launch a new feature where in certain apps that are  promising are boosted in visibility. The boost will manifest in multiple ways – higher priority in  recommendations sections (“Similar apps”, “You might also like”, “New and updated games”).  These will also get a boost in visibility in search results. This feature will help bring more  attention to newer apps that have potential.
